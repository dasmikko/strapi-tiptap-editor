## Notice!
**This project isn't actively maintained, as I want to move away from Strapi. If you are interested in taking over this project, feel free to contact me.**

## What is this?
It's a dead simple, and easy to use drop-in replacement for the built-in strapi WYSIWYG editor. It's build upon the [TipTap editor](https://tiptap.dev/).
It saves as plain HTML, making it easy to use with various frontends.


## Why make this?
The main reason was, that I thought that the built-in WYSIWYG editor in strapi could be better. I needed to support tables and css columns. Another requirement was also make it outputted pure html, and has a nice and easy to user interface. I don't want to keep toggling between editor mode and preview mode, just to see what I'm making.

## Requirements
It's build for Strapi **v4**. 

It has been tested to work with **v4.5.5** and I assume it should keep working with later versions.


## Cool! But how do I use it?
Luckily it's very easy to use. Just follow these instructions:

```
# Install the dependency
npm install strapi-tiptap-editor

# Add the following to the webpack config (/src/admin/webpack.config.js)
# This is due to tippy.js doesn't have an ES6 module, and a tiptap depencency imports it (thanks for the help @giu1io)
config.plugins.push(new webpack.NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(
  /^tippy\.js$/,
  'tippy.js/dist/tippy-bundle.umd.min.js'
))

# Build the Strapi Admin
npm run build
```

You are now using the new editor!

You can verify it, by looking at the plugins page inside Strapi
